# Reddit Scrapper

Reddit Scrapper is a tool to extract data from Reddit. It's used from a terminal and it's aimed to be an easy and relatively fast way to download massive quantities of text and metadata from any subreddit.

The objective of this tool is to create datasets (mainly focused on text) that can be useful for machine learning and NLP purposes. 
Reddit data allows access to massive communities involving millions of people in some cases, this project is a first step to explore the capabilities of the enormous quantity of open source data and how it can be used to extract knowledge from the chaos.

This project was inspired by the [GME short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze), and the question of how similar events can be predicted in the future using open source data.
